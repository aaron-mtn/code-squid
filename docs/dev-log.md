- 2026-08-22: Made session transcripts canonical for user-authored tasks.
  Initial and follow-up text now persist as raw `role=user` messages, while
  task/follow-up prompt guidance and invalid-reply corrections are assembled
  only for model requests. Resumed runs retain prior canonical context and the
  existing continuation guidance without saving control prompts as user turns.
- 2026-08-09: Added append-only `model_reply` and linked `reply_rejection`
  diagnostics to each session JSONL. Core now preserves provider-exposed raw
  tool arguments, content, reasoning/thinking, finish reason, usage, provider,
  model, and response IDs before validation, while diagnostic entries remain
  excluded from canonical conversation replay. Streaming provider adapters
  retain exposed finish/reasoning metadata as well.
- 2026-08-04: Added an explicit resolved-component seam to fresh run
  construction. Hosts that already resolved a Skill and executable tool
  registry can pass `resolved_skill` and `resolved_tools` together, bypassing
  discovery while Core continues to own run construction and execution. The
  seam is package-agnostic and adds no Core knowledge of Mods.
- 2026-08-04: Added optional `session_store_factory` and
  `undo_store_factory` inputs to fresh run construction and the convenience
  runner. Core still creates repository-local stores by default, while hosts
  can independently provide alternate persistence without replacing imported
  globals or exposing host storage layouts to Core.
- 2026-08-04: Added public metadata-to-runtime seams for package-aware hosts.
  `build_user_tool_registry_from_metadata(...)` builds Core's standard lazy
  executable entries from an explicit `UserTool` mapping, while
  `load_hook_infos(...)` instantiates an explicit `HookInfo` list. Desktop owns
  Mod-local/shared precedence because it owns package selection; Core continues
  to own safe tool execution, result normalization, source import, and hook
  factory behavior. Existing standalone discovery APIs and CLI behavior remain
  intact. Tests verify the explicit paths execute and that metadata-only
  discovery/registry construction does not import source.
- 2026-06-27: Skill prompts now omit default coding-agent tool guidance unless a skill explicitly provides its own `TOOL_USAGE_GUIDANCE` override.
- 2026-07-06: Added core extension discovery/state/validation. Extensions stay inactive until selected through `active_extension` state; runtime skill/tool/hook wiring is not included in this patch.
- 2026-07-06: Active extension skills/tools now participate in discovery. Extension tools are only active through selected skills that explicitly allow them; no-skill runs still use built-ins only.
- 2026-07-06: Active extension hooks now load while an extension is active and deactivate when the extension is inactive or invalid. Loose user hooks continue to work independently through the existing user-hook opt-in path.
- 2026-07-06: Added CLI extension management commands for listing, checking,
  activating, deactivating, and validating discovered user extensions.
